#               and the phone app's network rules (scripts/check-listeners.sh)
#   commit-msg  the message: AI-assistant attribution lines, personal data
#   pre-push    every commit about to be published: all of the above, plus author / committer emails
# Your own private strings (name, personal emails, Apple team id, device UDIDs, device names): add them with
# `python3 scripts/hooks/check-sensitive.py --private-add`. They are stored only as keyed fingerprints in
# .git/info/private-hashes (never committed), with the key in your macOS Keychain, so no file holds them in plain text.
