# check-listeners.sh - static rules for the phone app's network surface (GitHub issue #2). Run by tests/security/run.sh and the
# pre-commit hook. Fails (exit 1) when:
#   - an accept() in the app's servers is not followed by a connection filter (CableOnly.h cable_accept / the servers'
#     accept_ok_ / accept_loopback_only) within a few lines
#   - ggml's RPC server is started on anything but 127.0.0.1 (it has no authentication; the cable gate fronts it)
#   - the app advertises itself (Bonjour: NetService, NSBonjourServices) or a Swift file binds 0.0.0.0
#   - the control port's fetch / path checks (fetch_url_ok, safe_doc_path) are gone
#   - the Wi-Fi tunnel accepts a connection without its handshake
